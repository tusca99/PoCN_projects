\section{Framework (BTW sandpile on a graph)}
We simulate the Bak--Tang--Wiesenfeld (BTW) sandpile on a network with $N$ nodes.
Each node $i$ carries an integer load $z_i\in\{0,1,2,\dots\}$ and a threshold $z_c(i)$.
At each driving step one grain is added to a uniformly random node; then the system relaxes via topplings.
On a generic graph we take $z_c(i)=k_i$ (degree threshold), so one toppling at $i$ sends one grain to each neighbor.
To reach a stationary regime on finite networks we include dissipation with small probability $f$ so that avalanches remain finite~\cite{bonabeau1995sandpile,goh2003sandpile}.

An \emph{avalanche} is the full relaxation triggered by one grain addition.
We measure standard observables~\cite{bonabeau1995sandpile,goh2003sandpile}: size $S$ (total topplings), duration $T$ (number of update waves), and area $A$ (distinct toppled nodes).

\section{Results}
\paragraph{Baseline sanity check.}
In a mean-field/random-neighbor baseline~\cite{bonabeau1995sandpile}, increasing dissipation shifts the cutoff to smaller avalanches (Fig.~\ref{fig:bonabeau_ccdf}).

    \label{fig:bonabeau_ccdf}
\end{figure}
In both observables, larger dissipation reduces the probability of very large events, effectively moving the cutoff left.
\paragraph{Coupled modules (regular).}
We study two coupled networks (modules $A$ and $B$) with coupling probability $p$ and track whether a \emph{large} cascade happens (fixed cutoff in topplings), following~\cite{brummitt2012suppressing}.
We compare regular vs scale-free modules by plotting the same observables side-by-side: the probability of a large cascade in module $A$ (Fig.~\ref{fig:brummitt_local_compare}) and the probability of a large global cascade (Fig.~\ref{fig:brummitt_global_compare}).
\paragraph{Coupled modules (scale-free).}
As an extension, we repeat the coupled-network experiment with each module generated by a scale-free static model, consistent with the SOC-on-SF setting discussed in~\cite{goh2003sandpile}.
For brevity we do not report additional derived quantities (e.g., $p^*(\gamma)$).
In the scale-free panels, the shaded band shows a 95\% Wilson score confidence interval (binomial) for the estimated probability (from aggregated event counts).

    \caption{Coupled networks: probability of a large cascade in module $A$ versus coupling $p$ (regular vs scale-free modules).}
    \label{fig:brummitt_local_compare}
\end{figure}

The three curves separate cascades that stay in $A$ (local) from those triggered by activity arriving from the other module (inflicted), and their sum (any large in $A$)~\cite{brummitt2012suppressing}. Increasing coupling changes the balance between these contributions, as in the original coupled-module picture~\cite{brummitt2012suppressing}.

    \caption{Coupled networks: probability of a large \emph{global} cascade versus coupling $p$ (regular vs scale-free modules). }
    \label{fig:brummitt_global_compare}
\end{figure}

Global cascades depend non-trivially on coupling: very weak coupling limits spreading across modules, while stronger coupling increases the chance that an event involves both modules~\cite{brummitt2012suppressing}.
