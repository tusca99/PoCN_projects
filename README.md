# PoCN Projects

Short guide to the repo layout:

- `latex/`: the report (start from `latex/main.tex`).
- `task_15/`: Task 15 SOC code, data, and reproduction steps.
- `task_44/`: Task 44 (Social Connectedness Index) code, data, and outputs.

If you only want the final deliverable and figures, open the report in `latex/` and follow the figures/sections from there.
